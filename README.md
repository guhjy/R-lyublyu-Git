### 1.1 Inspiration

Basically I received an email from Medhi about Blakes's Github seminar and thought yeah I kept came across this github thing might as well see what is it about. And then I learnt about version control, what a great idea I wish I knew about this before I did my Diverticular project, if I did I wouldn't have spents like 100 hours redo and recover stuff after consistent system failures. 

What are benefits of incorporating Github with my R projects:

1. Version Control, keep track on your projects and makes it easier to collaborate. 
2. Able to browse and download other peoples shared codes, this is fun.
3. Create a public profile for myself, my github is the first thing that came up in google search if I search my name.
4. An alternative platform which I can do blog/notes, at Uni and at home. Better than than microsoft word. 
5. I can quickly present my projects or codes to other people by sending them a github repository link.
6. Need to use github if I was to create my personal website using R Blogdown.

Some cons

1. I procastinate on github, yeah I open up github and doen't know what to do and just chill there acting as if I am doing stuff.
2. I start worry about my coding abilities and start compare myself to other people. And this usually end up in me thinking I really suck and contemplating about my life. 
3. No spell check, now peopel will see how bad my spelling reallly is. Maybe I need to do my markdown files on an editor rather than do it on github.
